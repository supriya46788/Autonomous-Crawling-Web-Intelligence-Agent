# Autonomous Crawling Web Intelligence Agent

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Autonomous Crawling Web Intelligence Agent** is a **true agentic AI system** designed to autonomously explore websites, reason over their content, and answer user queries **only when verifiable evidence is found**.

Unlike traditional chatbots or simple tool-augmented LLMs, this system **plans, acts, evaluates, and iterates**—behaving like a real autonomous agent that navigates the web with a goal-driven mindset.

## ❓ Problem This Project Solves

Modern websites are large and information-dense. Users often need to:

* Scroll endlessly
* Click multiple pages
* Read irrelevant sections

…just to find one specific answer.

This project eliminates that friction by building an AI agent that:

* Explores the website on the user’s behalf
* Autonomously follows internal links
* Searches for evidence across multiple pages
* Returns a grounded answer—or explicitly says **NOT FOUND**

## 🔄 Agent Execution Flow 

1. **Goal Initialization**
   The agent receives a website URL and a user question.

2. **Planning Phase**
   A planning agent defines a clear navigation and verification strategy.

3. **Page Exploration**
   The agent reads the current page and cleans its content.

4. **Evidence Evaluation**
   A reasoning agent evaluates whether the page contains strong evidence.

5. **Decision Making**

   * If evidence is found → stop crawling
   * If not → discover new internal links

6. **Autonomous Crawling**
   The agent follows relevant links and repeats analysis.

7. **Final Answer Generation**
   The agent answers using **only verified evidence** or explicitly returns **NOT FOUND**.
